If you don't see spline points - restart your engine layout, sometimes its blocked.

If you don't see spline scripts or it doesn't work - check in console for compiler errors. We use editor scripts this kind of scripts will not start working until all compiler errors are gone. So if you have any errors from other assets this asset will be blocked until you solve that.

Import URP support pack ONLY if you use URP in your project. 
If you will import srp into standard project you will get shader errors.


Import HD RP support pack ONLY if you use HD RP in your project. 
If you will import srp into standard project you will get shader errors.
